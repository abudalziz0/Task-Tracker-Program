            "* **Explicit `None` Return:** The `sort_list_in_place` function now explicitly returns `None`.  While `list.sort()` implicitly returns `None`, explicitly returning it improves readability and makes it clear that the function's purpose is to modify the input list and not return a value.\n",
            "* **Sorting with a Custom Key:**  The `sort_list_by_length` example demonstrates how to use the `key` argument with both `sorted()` to sort a list of strings by their length.  This is a very powerful feature.  A second example is added to show how to sort a list of tuples by a specific element within the tuple.\n",
            "* **Lambda function example:** Uses a lambda function within the key parameter to easily specify which element to sort by.\n",
            "* **Concise Examples:** The examples are self-contained and easy to understand.\n",
            "* **Complete Code:** The code is complete and runnable.  You can copy and paste it directly into a Python interpreter or script.\n",

            "How to use the code and which method to choose:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **`sorted(my_list)`:**\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Use this if you want to create a *new* sorted list without modifying the original list.  This is generally the preferred approach if you need to keep the original list intact.  It's also suitable if you are sorting an iterable that is *not* a list (e.g., a tuple or a string).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **`my_list.sort()`:**\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Use this if you want to sort the list *in place* (i.e., modify the original list directly).  This is more efficient if you don't need the original list after sorting.  This *only* works on lists.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **`sorted(my_list, key=...)` or `my_list.sort(key=...)`:**\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Use these when you need to sort based on a custom criterion (e.g., length of strings, a specific element of tuples, or a more complex calculation). The `key` argument takes a function that will be applied to each element of the list to determine its sorting value.  The `key` can be a regular function or a lambda function.\n",
